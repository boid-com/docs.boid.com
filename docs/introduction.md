## BOID - The social supercomputer
Boid is an EOS decentralized application (dApp). At the heart of Boid is the desire to make the benefits of blockchain technology accessible to all people. Boid acts as a gateway, lowering the barrier to entry for non-technical users to directly participate in blockchains and distributed computing projects. Boid is a website and software platform that provides a social gateway for individuals to contribute their computing power towards big ideas and get rewarded for it. The Boid platform makes it easy for users to participate in distributed computing projects. Boid also incorporates the latest blockchain protocols, providing monetary incentives for the sharing of spare computing resources.

## What does “Boid” mean?
Boid is short for bird-oid. A computer simulation of birds in a flock. Each “boid” follows simple rules of interaction with nearby boids. Many boids interacting results in emergent meta patterns. Likewise, the Boid Platform relies on computing resources from many individual contributors. These small contributions cumulate into massive real-world impact.
Who is Boid for?
Boid is for anyone who wants to be part of something huge. We designed Boid from the ground up to be as accessible as technologically possible. Anyone with a computer (or compatible smartphone) and internet connection can use Boid.
Is Boid safe?
Security is a top priority for Boid. We only work with the most reputable distributed science projects, and we architected the Boid app such that applications have limited permissions. It’s worth noting that BOINC (the tech behind Boid) has been commonly used since the late 90s with a perfect security track record due to a robust security architecture. We continue to roll out updates to make Boid even more secure and hacker-proof.
How can I contribute computing power towards Boid?
To increase your Boid Power, you need to install the simple Boid application on your device. The Boid application runs in the background, transparently taking advantage of unused computing power. The Boid application connects to your Boid account, and can tap into your CPU, GPU, and HDD space automatically, to maximize your Boid Power rating. You can install the Boid app on as many of your devices as you like. Desktop computers with dedicated GPUs tend to perform the best, but laptops can also work as well.
You can even rent a specialised service in the cloud with BOID Power to mine BOID.
### Income
Your Boid Power can be used to mine for various cryptos. Get paid out daily however you like. Stake your BOID tokens, look for Bounties and earn rewards. Create a team, become and ambassador or validator. It's only the beginning.
