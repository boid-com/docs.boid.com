**While there is no official list of netiquette rules or guidelines, the general idea is to respect others online. Below are some examples of rules to follow for good netiquette:**

1. **The Human Element**
    * Words, photos, or videos that you post are read by real people and they all deserve respectful communication. So before you press that “send” or “submit button, ask yourself “would I have a problem if someone else had written it?”. Whenever you communicate online, through email, instant messaging, group discussion, or any cyber activity, remember the golden rule “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you”.
2. **If you Wouldn’t Do It in Real Life, Don’t Do It Online**
    * Privacy is a universal concern, and it got that attention for a reason. The consequences are sometimes critical. You often see this phenomenon with journalists who invade people’s lives to get a story. You might make the same mistake without even knowing. Maybe you mentioned someone in a rather embarrassing story or wrote a post that revealed something they were trying to hide. What do you think the consequences would be? Embarrassment? Hurt feelings? Job loss maybe? So remember the rule: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you”. Respect others' privacy by not sharing personal information, photos, or videos that another person may not want published online.
    * Never spam others by sending large amounts of unsolicited pictures or links. Don't troll people on the channel by repeatedly nagging or annoying them.
    * Avoid posting inflammatory or offensive comments online (a.k.a flaming).
    * Avoid replying to negative comments with more negative comments. Instead, break the cycle with a positive post.
3. **Respect People’s Time and Bandwidth**  
With the tech revolution taking over, people’s attention span is getting shorter with every distraction your phone can hold. Online communication consumes time and bandwidth (megabytes) and people lead busy lives these days; between work, school and social life, you don’t want to be that stop sign with your fancy elaborated paragraph. Keep it short and simple, and tone down on sending videos and photos that people need to download. Data plans are not free, you know!
4. **Check Yourself**  
If the online space brought any good, it’s the comfort of sitting in your pyjamas! Nobody can judge your appearance, voice tone, or what you wear (unless you’re one of those people who go on Facebook Live wearing tank tops and chain smoking). You will, however, be judged based on your content and engagement, so keep these tips in mind:
    * Perform spell-checking and grammar errors, especially in professional communications.
    * Make sure you did your homework on the subject and chose clear words.
    * Be positive and courteous in your general behaviour.
5. **Share Your Expertise**  
The term “Social Media” was a revolution for a reason – it’s Social! That means you are not limited to communicating with companies only, but to the world at large. Information that you provide can live on the internet forever, where it will remain accessible by people for years to come. Sharing your expertise consistently plays a big part in shaping your personal brand; this is how influencers are made. If someone asks a question and you know the answer, offer to help. Also thank others who help you online.
6. **Extinguish Flame Wars (metaphorically speaking)**  
Flaming is when people express their annoyance on a subject without withholding their emotions. We often see these in posts where people are wholeheartedly expressing their opinion, and it’s not a taboo online. Flame wars, however, is when two or more people exchange angry and explicit posts between each other, and this must be controlled before it escalates to compromise the integrity of the group you’re in. Don’t feed the flames; extinguish them by guiding the discussion back to a more productive direction.
7. **With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility**  
You might not possess the powers of Spiderman, but being extremely tech-savvy these days gives you great leverage. If that’s you, make sure you’re not abusing your power to hurt others. Thou shalt not hack your friends, for instance.
8. **Forgive**  
Not everyone has the same amount of experience working in the virtual world. And not everyone knows the rules of netiquette. At some point, you will see a stupid question, read an unnecessarily long response, or encounter misspelled words; when this happens, practice kindness and forgiveness as you would hope someone would do if you had committed the same offense. If it’s a minor “offense,” you might want to let it slide. If you feel compelled to respond to a mistake, do so in a message rather than a public forum.
