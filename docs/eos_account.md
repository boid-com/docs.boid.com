>You need to link your EOS account to Boid to be able to stake BOID tokens.

If you already have an EOS account - Great! Just link it to your Boid account on the app.boid.com site. When everything is setup you should be able to claim your BOID tokens straight to your EOS account or have stake delegated to you.

If you don’t know what EOS is take a look at this video: [EOS Explained](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/eos-blockchain/) or this one [EOS Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUFiACzmlPw).

So if you don’t have an EOS account check out our CreateEOSAccount option on Boid portal. We prepared few ways for you to get an EOS account. You can do it here: [EOS create](https://app.boid.com/CreateEOSAccount)
