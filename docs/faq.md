## How Web App Calculator Works?
![Calculator](/img/calculator_1.jpeg "Calculator")
In **Power** field when you go to the calculator it should show your existing Boid power on chain. You can enter any number there to see how your payouts will change with different power levels.

**BOID Stake**  gives you a chance to see what will happen when you stake different amount of tokens. Think about lending some tokens on Chintai if you don't have enough, so you can maximize your earnings.

**Max Powered Stake** is connected to your Boid Power. If you don't have enough power your powered stake will suffer.

**Unpowered stake** is when you have more staked tokens than your powered stake. That's why your unpowered stake bonus will be payed out to the **WPF**.

**Worker Fund (Worker Proposal Fund or WPF)** provides funding for users that help grow and promote the Boid ecosystem. So it's not a bad idea to overstake a little bit to add some BOID to the fund.
Look how much we have in the fund now: https://stats.boid.com/d/YrQi9xhZk/boidcomtoken-blockchain-tracking?orgId=1&theme=light&panelId=19&fullscreen

Switch between **DAY, WEEK, MONTH** to see how much you can earn.

> There is a connection between how much power you have and how much active stake you have. It's good to analyse your possibilities.
>> Remember that Chintai is a very useful exchange to use to maximize your earnings! https://chintai.io

## How to find your device id?

Go to the main page of https://app.boid.com/  
On the right hand side in **"My Devices"** window look at the list of your devices and click on the **"i"** icon next to it

A new window should appear and this is where you should be able to find it. This is just an example. Every device **id** is different.
